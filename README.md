# CheckYo'Self

CheckYo'Self is a orginizational app that I built in Module 1 during my time at Turing Software and Design. The objective of the project is to create a fully dynamic checklist board that allow a user to simplify an otherwise busy life. The app allows for the user to build a to-do list consisting of as many tasks as needed to complete a project. Once, the list is added to the board it remains in local storage until the user completes all the tasks and clicks the delete button. For those more important things, CheckYo'Self allows for a user to set a to-do to urgent and shades that particular list differently than the others so it may stand out. The user may also search for a certain list title or filter all lists by urgency. So what are you waiting for? Try it out!
